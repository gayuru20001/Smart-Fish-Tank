# Smart-Fish-Tank
I designed and built a smart fish tank system using an ESP32 microcontroller and the Blynk platform. This system allows for real-time monitoring and automation of key functions.
The main features are:

    Automated Feeding: You can control a servo motor to feed the fish remotely using a mobile app.

    Water Monitoring: Sensors provide real-time data on the water's temperature and pH levels, helping to maintain a healthy environment for the fish.

    Low Water Alert: A float sensor detects low water levels and sends an alert so you can add more water.

    Remote Lighting: An LED light strip can be controlled wirelessly through the app.

    Real-Time Notifications: The system sends alerts directly to your phone for feeding times and low water conditions.
